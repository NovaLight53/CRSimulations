My Clash Royale simulation code

In this repo there is code for a simulation of Clash Royale's 3 losses and you're out challenge system.  There is also a way to set the percentage of players with pass royale (infinite retries) and a customizable number of wins to finish a challenge

UPDATE 5/31/21: challengeSimCustomizable is an updated version of the challengeDiff.py file.  The new file can test even distribution and set a skill for pass royale players. 

UPDATE 11/20/21: ChallengeSimulator uploaded.  It is a more simplistic version that only tests the n loss and you're out challenge versions.  However, it uses insertion and binary search to run significantly faster than other versions. For large scale testing, I suggest using this file.
